## SunnySideApp - Serving You Weather With A Smile

SunnySideApp is the number one weather App for accessible weather. 
The program's format gathers data from the Tomorrow Weather API that allows users to input 
their zip code or city and recieve up-to-date information about the locations forecast.  
A simple run of commands can give you plenty of different weather services from real time weather to
daily forecast for the next five days!

Other than the previous API mentioned, no other technologies were used in this project. 
This program should work fine with a local terminal.
