# SunnySideApp - Serving You Weather With A Smile
SunnySideApp is the number one weather App for accessible weather. 
* The program's format gathers data from the Tomorrow Weather API that allows users to input 
their zip code or city and recieve up-to-date information about the locations forecast.  
* A simple run of commands can give you plenty of different weather services from real time weather to
daily forecast for the next five days!

* Other than the previous API mentioned, no other technologies were used in this project. 
* This program should work fine with a local terminal.
