## SunnySideApp - Serving You Weather With A Smile

SunnySideApp is the number one weather App for accessible weather. 
The program's format gathers data from the Tomorrow Weather API that allow users to simply input 
their zip code or city and recieve up-to-date information about that location's weather forecast.  
A simple run of commands can give you plenty of different weather services from real time weather to
daily forecast for the next five days!

Other than the previously mentioned API, there are no other technologies used in this project. The program should run smoothly in your local terminal.
